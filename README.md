**- How the app functions (features list)** (cred ca am inclus aici feature urile, daca lipseste cv adaugati)

Basically, the user can either opt for scanning a receipt or create a checklist. If he chose to scan an receipt, he will be asked to take a photo of the receipt or use a photo from the gallery. Either way, the scanner will build a list containing the products (name and price). The user can modify this checklist should it contain any mistakes by adding, deleting or clearing the list. These operations can be done by pressing the buttons having the same names. Alongside with the name of the product and the price, the checklist also contains a checkbox which allows the user to select that product. After the checklist is finalized, each buyer will select the products that he consumed by pressing the checkbox of the product. When he finishes, he will press 'Done' button and the total sum will apear on the screen.
